{"name":"PSET","tagline":"Passive Subdomain Enumeration Tools","body":"###PSET\r\nPSET stands for Passive Subdomain Enumeration Tool, which goal is: given a domain PSET will enumerate all subdomains passively by probing search engines such as Goole.com and Bing.com. PSET will never directly probe any DNS and server or any host belonging to target domain. Making enumeration scans 100% stealth and undetectable.\r\n\r\n[Download latest version](https://github.com/jrrombaldo/pset/blob/master/pset-0.1.jar)\r\n\r\n####Running\r\nBasically PSET can run using a java GUI or from CLI. Keep in mind that even on CLI mode it's opens an popup with captcha images, so in case you are on CLI only environment you wont't be able clear captchas when runs PSET multiple times.\r\n\r\n1. To run GUI mode it's just execute: `java -jar pset-0.1.jar `\r\n2. To run CLI mode execute the same jar passing -c param `java -jar pset-0.1.jar -c`. \r\n\r\nHere is an example of possible parameters:  \r\n`java -jar pset-0.1.jar -h`  \r\n`usage: java -jar pset.jar [at least on search engine] target.com`  \r\n` -b,--bing           Use bing search engine`  \r\n` -c,--cli            Use CLI mode, otherwise will start GUI mode`  \r\n` -d,--domain <arg>   Target domain`  \r\n` -g,--google         Use google search engine`  \r\n` -h,--help           Show usage help`  \r\n` -p,--proxy <arg>    Use HTTP proxy format: host:port`  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n####Download and compiling\r\n\r\nIn order to download and compile PSET you must have [apache maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi), [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and [java development kit 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) installed, as they are required to build/compile the source code into jar file.\r\n\r\n1- Download the latest version from github:   \r\n `git clone https://github.com/jrrombaldo/pset`\r\n\r\n2- Compile and build the jar:  \r\n `cd pset && mvn clean install`\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's done, the final jar will at `pset/pset-0.1.jar`, follow the steps to execute it.\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-44896718-3","note":"Don't delete this file!
